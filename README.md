# *Image Recognition with Machine Learning in R (or Python)*

## A simple guide

### By Taco Bakker

Goal: Build an Image Recognition web app, using your own selected photos.

---

## Part 1: prerequisites

1. A good performing computer (Windows, Mac, Linux)
2. Internet connection
3. Basic knowledge of IT, programming and machine learning would be nice
4. A good learning mood

## Part 2: prepare your computer

*Install R*

[Download R Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

[Download R Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)

*Install R Studio*

[Download Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

For this workshop you need some dependencies from *Python*.
If you don't have Python on your machine install it:

[download python mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)

[download python windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

## Part 3: find a project

What is it that you want to recognise?
What tree is this? What animal? What city?
Note that you need at least 100 jpg pictures per class to make the algorithm work properly.
And preferably more. (say 500).
Downloading these one-by-one will take you a lot of time.
So try to find a ready-to-use dataset.
Kaggle is my favorite, but there are many others.

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/),
[OpenImages](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html),
[CIFAR](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html),
[ImageNet](https://image-net.org/),
[the Visual Genome](http://visualgenome.org/),
[COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home)

In the example I have used these datasets:
- https://www.kaggle.com/biancaferreira/african-wildlife
- https://www.kaggle.com/jerrinbright/cheetahtigerwolf

## Part 4: organizing your data

Your data must be organized in separate folders per class.
In the example below I have selected 6 animals.
Note: limit your classes to 5-6 when you start.
Deep Learning requires a lot of computer power.
If your computer can handle it, you can add more classes.

Every folder contains a number of jpg photos of an animal species.
Note that the SNAKE has a very low amount of files (76).

`tacobakker@MacBook-Pro-van-Taco:~/Downloads/ANIMALS|⇒  ls -l`\
`total 0`\
`drwxr-xr-x@   76  tacobakker  staff   2432 Aug 18 13:40 SNAKE`\
`drwxr-xr-x@ 723 tacobakker  staff  23136 Aug 17 18:09 TIGER`\
`drwxr-xr-x@ 821 tacobakker  staff  26272 Aug 17 18:09 TORTOISE`\
`drwxr-xr-x@ 733 tacobakker  staff  23456 Aug 17 18:09 WALRUS`\
`drwxr-xr-x@ 907 tacobakker  staff  29024 Aug 17 18:09 WOLF`\
`drwxr-xr-x@ 878 tacobakker  staff  28096 Aug 17 18:09 ZEBRA`

We now need to split the data in a TRAIN set and a TEST set.
- Create a train folder and a test folder.
- Copy all downloaded folders to the train folder.
- In the test folder, create a sub-folder for every class.
- Move at least 5 pictures per class from the train folder to the test folder.

You can use the script *splitdata.sh* to do all of this automatically.

Suppose you store the data in a folder called ANIMALS,
the structure should look something like this:

`ANIMALS`\
`├── test`\
`│   ├── SNAKE`\
`│   ├── TIGER`\
`│   ├── TORTOISE`\
`│   ├── WALRUS`\
`│   ├── WOLF`\
`│   └── ZEBRA`\
`└── train`\
`        ├── SNAKE`\
`        ├── TIGER`\
`        ├── TORTOISE`\
`        ├── WALRUS`\
`        ├── WOLF`\
`        └── ZEBRA`

## Part 5: Prepare Rstudio

- [Copy the example code from GitHub](https://github.com/SonnyBurnett/image_recognition)
- Open Rstudio
- Open the file trainModel.R
- Save it under your own name in a folder of your choice

Now you need to install some R packages.
- Go to the "Console" in Rstudio. (Usually the lower left window)
- Note: This window will have 3 tabs. Console, Terminal, Jobs.
- type: (don't get scared by red text)
- `install_tensorflow(extra_packages="pillow")`
- `install_keras()`
- `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- `install.packages("reticulate")`

- Now go to tab "Terminal". Here we will install some Python dependencies.
- type: (either pip3 or pip)
- `pip3 install --upgrade pip`
- `pip3 install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose`

*TensorFlow* is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
*Keras* is a deep learning API written in *Python*,
running on top of the machine learning platform *TensorFlow*.
Keras needs some Python libraries,
which we install with pip.

The *reticulate* package provides tools to use python in R.
*Tidyverse* is a collection of R packages designed for data science.

## Part 6: Prepare the R script that generates the model

trainModel.R - R script to create and train the model\
app.R        - R Shiny app to use the model\

Open trainModel.R in R Studio.
First we will load the 4 libraries we need.\
Run them one-by-one to see if everything works as expected.

If you prepared your folders correctly you only have to specify
the path to the images.
You can leave all other values untouched.\
`path_data <- "your_path_to_your_images"`

The first part of the script sets the variables we need.

In the second part the data is prepared so it can be used for training.
- The images are split into a train set and a validation set (array of images).
- Also the images are resized to reduce processing time and to unify.
- This can take a little bit of time if you have many images.
- Your output will look something like this:

`Found 3274 images belonging to 6 classes.`\
`Found 817 images belonging to 6 classes.`

In the Third part a model is created.
- The model is build upon a standard image Recognition Neural Network
- We will add a top layer on this NN for our own images.

In the fourth part the model is trained with our image data.
- Please note that this can take 10-60 minutes
- Depending on the amount of images and the power of your computer.
- The CPU will get hot on this one ;-)
- The plot is optional but shows nicely the progress of the training.
- You should get output like this:

`Epoch 1/6`\
`102/102 - 214s - loss: 0.8513 - accuracy: 0.7819 - val_loss: 0.2262 - val_accuracy: 0.9325`\
`Epoch 2/6`\
`102/102 - 234s - loss: 0.2046 - accuracy: 0.9294 - val_loss: 0.2431 - val_accuracy: 0.9175`\
`Epoch 3/6`\
`102/102 - 158s - loss: 0.1675 - accuracy: 0.9399 - val_loss: 0.2010 - val_accuracy: 0.9300`\
`Epoch 4/6`\
`102/102 - 157s - loss: 0.1096 - accuracy: 0.9605 - val_loss: 0.1754 - val_accuracy: 0.9400`\
`Epoch 5/6`\
`102/102 - 155s - loss: 0.0766 - accuracy: 0.9722 - val_loss: 0.1903 - val_accuracy: 0.9312`\
`Epoch 6/6`\
`102/102 - 156s - loss: 0.0670 - accuracy: 0.9759 - val_loss: 0.2527 - val_accuracy: 0.9112`

Note that in the last epoch your loss value should be close to zero
and your accuracy value should be close to one.

In the Fifth part we test our model.

Run everything line-by-line to check if things work as expected.


## Part 7: Create an interactive dashboard

R Studio has a nice package called R Shiny.
Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.

Purpose: Load a jpg/jepg picture and the dashboard will show what it is (or not.

Name: app.R (standard) - see example in the code.


The app consists of 6 parts:
- 7.A. Initial work
- 7.B. Load libraries
- 7.C. Load model and data
- 7.D. Define the User Interface
- 7.E. Define the Data Processing
- 7.F. Create the app


### Part 7.A: Initial work. (Only needs to be done once)

- Run the R script that creates and saves your prediction model.
- Create a folder on your computer, and name it as you want your app the be called. (e.g. imageApp)
- Within this folder create a folder called "www"
- Copy the model and the label list to the www folder (folder: "animal_mod", file: "label_list.Rdata")
- In the console type: setwd("<path_to_your_imageApp>"). This is for local use only.
- Install the packages if needed. \
install.packages("shiny") \
install.packages("shinydashboard") \
install.packages("rsconnect")


### Part 7.B: Load the libraries

Look in the code for the libraries that need to be loaded.

### Part 7.C: Load the model and the label list

Also set some variables and settings


### Part 7.D: UI - Definition of the User Interface, with the variables.

The UI consists of 3 elements:
- Header \
  No variables, just static content
- Sidebar \
Input variable: "input_image"    type: File
- Body \
Output variables: \
"output_image"            type: imageOutput     the uploaded photo \
"warning_text"            type: textOutput      show message if prediction is unclear \
"output_prediction_text"  type: tableOutput     show prediction output, per class


### Part 7.E: Server - Define the data processing

Retrieve, Process and Show the data in the UI

Retrieve: Input variable "input_image" is retrieved via "input$input_image"

Process:  The input variable is loaded into the model \
          which produces a prediction (a table with percentages) \
          Note: this is a function that is called in the "Show" part.

Show:     Output variable "output_prediction_text" is shown by "output$output_prediction_text" \
          by calling the prediction function \
          Output variable "warning_text" is shown by "output$warning_text" \
          But only if the highest prediction is lower or equal to 30% \
          Output variable "output_image" is shown by "output$output_image" \
          But it has to be retrieved first.

### Part 7.F: create the shinyApp

This is basically just a simple call to start the dashboard.

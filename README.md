# *Image Recognition with Machine Learning in R*

## A simple guide

### By Taco Bakker

Goal: Build an Image Recognition web app, using your own photos.

## Part 1: prerequisites

1. A good performing computer (Windows, Mac, Linux)
2. Internet connection
3. Basic knowledge of programming
4. A good learning mood

## Part 2: prepare your computer

*Install R*

Download R Mac
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/

Download R Windows
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/

*Install R Studio*

[Download Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

For this workshop you need some dependencies from Python.
If you don't have Python on your machine install it:

download python mac
https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/

download python windows
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

## Part 3: find a project

What is it that you want to recognise?
What tree is this? What animal? What city?
Note that you need at least 100 jpg pictures per class,
to make the algorithm work properly.
And preferably more. (say 500).
Downloading these one-by-one will take you a lot of time.
So try to find a ready-to-use dataset.
Kaggle is my favorite, but there are many others.
